<P> EQUINOX is back this year in its ninth year of running!

    Who Are We?
    We are a student-led annual charity fashion show held in SISHK. Our aim is to provide a platform for students from schools all over HK to collaborate together, with the opportunity to express themselves artistically through designing, modeling, and performing.
    
    All funds raised by Equinox go to the OneSky Foundation, an organization that teaches caregivers to provide the best nurturing care to orphaned and abandoned children. OneSky can be found not only in Hong Kong but also in China, Mongolia, and Vietnam. Here is a link to their website, where you can find out more about the meaningful work they do: <a href="https://onesky.org/" target="_blank">https://onesky.org/</a>
    
    Equinox in AY2223
    Our theme for this year is: Hymn to the Nightshade 
    This year’s equinox pays tribute to the Garden of Eden; the story of the Garden of Eden depicts humanity’s fall from grace, as well as the human condition, progressing from purity, innocence and a state of ignorant bliss to the knowledge of sin.
    The name originates from the word hymn, a song of praise paid to ethereal beings, reflected in our first two subthemes, seraphic and dew drop. Much like the story, the themes take on a dark twist, going on to nightshade. The deadly nightshade was seen as the devil’s property, thus in literature and art, it symbolizes danger, betrayal. This is demonstrated in the subthemes belladonna and decay.
